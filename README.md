NOTE:
  - (For testing only) For novel miRNA discovery, be sure to copy training.smir and test.smir files to your working directory, and install pcregrep and parallel commands.
  - Small RNA RNAseq file processing program mirna_processing.sh only supports UNIX/UNIX-like systems. 

Installation:

  - Install devtools
  
        install.packages("devtools")

Update log

    0.2.4 (Dec.7.2021)
      - mirDeepProcess() function added to process conserved miRNA count resutls from miRDeep2
      - The "mir_count" object updated with "genes_complete_annotation" data frame
        - The print function for "mir_count" updated accordingly

    0.2.3 (Jan.17.2019)
      - New bioconductor installation instructions added
      
      
    0.2.2
      - "files_processed" added to "mir_count" object
      - A bug fixed for mirProcess function where the function will improperly check target.annot.file even if it's set at NULL
    
    
    0.2.1
      - Adjustments made to "mir_count" objects
        - The object now outputs genes and counts separately
        - The object now outputs library size for the samples
        
      - Bug fixes


    0.2.0
      - New functions
        - S3 print function for "mir_count"
          
      - Updates to exisiting functions:
        - mirProcess() re-written, with:
          - simplied code base
          - foreach implementation of parallel computing
          - compatibility for UNIX/UNIX-like/Windows systems
          - non-mandatory naming convention for input .txt read count files
          - ability to take annotation file
          - output in S3 object "mir_count"
              
      - A preview of UNIX Shell program mirna_processing added
      - Other updates
          - Information page updated
